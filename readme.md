# Pokemon Fenton Region

This will be a open world game similar to Pokemon.

### Tech stack (Javascript, CSS, HTML)

![Slide 1](Pokemon-Wireframe.png)

## MVP Goals
### Single pikachu wandering around on Player Movement Area (as opposed to a player with a selection of battle-doers)
### Pikachu can battle against Pokemon object which is instigated by simply pressing "B" key
### Pikachu / Pokemon object have health and can either Attack or Heal in their turn
### When someone runs out of health, battle ends and another can commence (return to initial state)
### Track max number of battles won before fainting

## Stretch Goals
### Sprite for moving characters
### Pikachu levels up due to xp earned in battle
### Grass, Water, Fire, Electric, Normal types of pokemon
### Grid of 'tall grass' which randomly disperses pokemon
### Poke-Center to heal Pikachu
### Gym Leader (obvi named Gary) at the end has 3 different pokemon which must be beaten without healing inbetween
### Create trainer who holds multiple Pokemon

## Potential roadblocks
### Saving place in game to a file would be handy/neat


## How it works
### There is a roaming phase and a battling phase
### Roaming is outside of battle when Player is walking around looking for things
